# UTD Game Jam 2020

Follow the classic advice of Uncle Iroh as he guides you through the first 5 levels in the Air Nation section of Avatar: The Last Platformer! Befriend the local sky bison and use your trusty glider to navigate the skies and make it to the door at the end of each level.

I worked alongside UTD students [Hansika Sundaresan](https://github.com/hansikasundaresan) and [Ashwin Somasundaram](https://github.com/AshwinSomasundaram) over the course of a week to learn unity and make this 2D platformer game. Check out the [itch.io page](https://rdchan.itch.io/the-avatar) and play in-browser!
